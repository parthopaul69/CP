There is a game called "I Wanna Be the Guy", consisting of *n* levels. Little X and his friend Little Y are addicted to the game. Each of them wants to pass the whole game.

Little X can pass only *p* levels of the game. And Little Y can pass only *q* levels of the game. You are given the indices of levels Little X can pass and the indices of levels Little Y can pass. Will Little X and Little Y pass the whole game, if they cooperate each other?

## Input

The first line contains a single integer *n* (1 ≤  *n* ≤ 100). 

The next line contains an integer *p* (0 ≤ *p* ≤ *n*) at first, then follows *p* distinct integers *a*_(1), *a*_(2), ..., *a*_(*p*) (1 ≤ *a*_(*i*) ≤ *n*). These integers denote the indices of levels Little X can pass. The next line contains the levels Little Y can pass in the same format. It's assumed that levels are numbered from 1 to *n*.

## Output

If they can pass all the levels, print "`I become the guy.`". If it's impossible, print "`Oh, my keyboard!`" (without the quotes).

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 4

```

**Output 1:**

```
I become the guy.

```

**Example 2:**

```
4
3 1 2 3
2 2 3

```

**Output 2:**

```
Oh, my keyboard!

```

## Note

In the first sample, Little X can pass levels [1 2 3], and Little Y can pass level [2 4], so they can pass all the levels both.

In the second sample, no one can pass level 4.
