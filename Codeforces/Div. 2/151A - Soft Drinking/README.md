This winter is so cold in Nvodsk! A group of `n` friends decided to buy `k` bottles of a soft drink called "Take-It-Light" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has `l` milliliters of the drink. Also they bought `c` limes and cut each of them into `d` slices. After that they found `p` grams of salt.

To make a toast, each friend needs `nl` milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and `np` grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?

## Input

The first and only line contains **positive** integers `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `d`, `p`, `nl`, `np`, not exceeding `1000` and no less than `1`. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.

## Output

Print a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1
```

**Output 1:**

```
2
```

**Example 2:**

```
5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3
```

**Output 2:**

```
3
```

**Example 3:**

```
10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1
```

**Output 3:**

```
0
```

## Note

A comment to the first sample: 

Overall the friends have `4 * 5 = 20` milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make `20 / 3 = 6` toasts. The limes are enough for `10 * 8 = 80` toasts and the salt is enough for `100 / 1 = 100` toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is `min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2`.
