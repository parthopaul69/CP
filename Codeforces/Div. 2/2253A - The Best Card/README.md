In a card game, there are `n` cards with values `2, 3, 4, …, n + 1`.

To determine which of two cards with values `x` and `y` wins, apply the following rules: 

 - if one of the numbers `x` and `y` is divisible by the other, the card with the smaller value wins;
- otherwise, the card with the larger value wins.

For example, between cards `2` and `6`, card `2` wins because `6` is divisible by `2`. Between cards `4` and `6`, card `6` wins because neither of these numbers is divisible by the other.

Determine whether there exists a card that wins against every other card.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer `n` (`2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`) — the number of cards in the game.

Additional constraints on the input: 

 - the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `3 · 10^6`.

## Output

For each test case, print `YES` if there is a card that wins against all other cards, and `NO` otherwise.

Each letter may be printed in either case. For example, `YES`, `yes`, and `yEs` are all recognized as a positive answer.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
2
3
4
5
8
```

**Output:**

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
```

## Note

In the first test case, the available cards have values `2` and `3`. Card `3` wins against card `2`.

In the second test case, the available cards have values `2`, `3`, and `4`. Card `2` wins against card `4`, card `3` wins against card `2`, and card `4` wins against card `3`, so there is no suitable card.
