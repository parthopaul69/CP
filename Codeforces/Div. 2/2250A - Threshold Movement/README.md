There are `n+2` positions numbered from `0` to `n+1`. Initially, position `i` contains an element of weight `w_i` for every `1≤ i≤ n`, while positions `0` and `n+1` are empty.

You choose an integer `k`. Then every element moves exactly once, simultaneously:

 - If `w_i < k`, the element at position `i` moves to position `i-1`;
- If `w_i > k`, the element at position `i` moves to position `i+1`;
- If `w_i=k`, the entire movement process fails immediately.

An integer `k` is *perfect* if the movement does not fail and, upon completion, every position from `1` to `n` contains exactly one element.

Determine whether a *perfect* integer `k` exists.

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 500`). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer `n` (`1≤ n≤ 100`).

The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `w_1,w_2,…,w_n` (`1≤ w_i≤ 10^9`).

## Output

For each test case, print "`YES`" if a *perfect* integer `k` exists, and "`NO`" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "`yEs`", "`yes`", "`Yes`", and "`YES`" will be recognized as positive responses.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
6
1
7
2
3 1
2
2 1
4
9 1 7 2
4
9 8 7 1
6
1000000000 1 9 2 8 3
```

**Output:**

```
NO
YES
NO
YES
NO
YES
```

## Note

In the first test case, the only element either leaves position `1` or has weight equal to `k`, so no suitable integer exists.

In the second test case, choose `k=2`. The element of weight `3` moves right and the element of weight `1` moves left, leaving one element in each position.

In the third test case, keeping both positions occupied would require `1 < k < 2`, which is impossible for an integer `k`.

In the fourth test case, `k=5` is suitable: the elements at positions `1` and `3` move right, while those at positions `2` and `4` move left. Upon completion, every position from `1` to `4` contains exactly one element.

In the fifth test case, the element at position `2` must move left, requiring `k > 8`, while the element at position `3` must move right, requiring `k < 7`. These requirements are incompatible.

In the sixth test case, choose `k=4`. All elements at odd positions move right and all elements at even positions move left, so every position from `1` to `6` contains one element afterwards.
