An integer `n` is said to be *good* if it contains **at most** two distinct digits in its decimal representation. For example, the integers `3`, `8588`, `67` are good, whereas the integers `123`, `9447` are not. 

You are given an integer `x` (`1 ≤ x < 10^8`), which is good. Your task is to find an integer `y` (`2 ≤ y ≤ 10^9`) such that both of the following conditions are satisfied: 

 - `y` is good.
- `x × y` is good.

## Input

The first line contains an integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows. 

Each test case contains a single integer `x` (`1 ≤ x < 10^8`). **It is guaranteed that `x` is good.**

## Output

For each test case, print a single integer `y` (`2 ≤ y ≤ 10^9`) such that both the integers `y` and `x × y` are good.

If there are multiple valid answers, output any one of them.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
4
8
73
299
6767
```

**Output:**

```
11
4
26
3366
```

## Note

For the first test case, we have `x = 8`; choosing `y = 11` is valid because both `y = 11` and `x × y = 88` are good.

For the second test case, we have `x = 73`; choosing `y = 4` is valid because both `y = 4` and `x × y = 292` are good.
