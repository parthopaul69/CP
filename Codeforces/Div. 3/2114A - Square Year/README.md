*One can notice the following remarkable mathematical fact: the number `2025` can be represented as `(20+25)^2`.*

You are given a year represented by a string `s`, consisting of exactly `4` characters. Thus, leading zeros are allowed in the year representation. For example, "0001", "0185", "1375" are valid year representations. You need to express it in the form `(a + b)^2`, where `a` and `b` are **non-negative integers**, or determine that it is impossible.

For example, if `s` = "0001", you can choose `a = 0`, `b = 1`, and write the year as `(0 + 1)^2 = 1`.

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) — the number of test cases.

The following lines describe the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string `s`, consisting of exactly `4` characters. Each character is a digit from `0` to `9`.

## Output

On a separate line for each test case, output: 

 - Two numbers `a` and `b` (`a, b ≥ 0`) such that `(a + b)^2 = s`, if they exist. If there are multiple suitable pairs, you may output any of them.
- The number `-1` otherwise.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
5
0001
1001
1000
4900
2025
```

**Output:**

```
0 1
-1
-1
34 36
20 25

```
