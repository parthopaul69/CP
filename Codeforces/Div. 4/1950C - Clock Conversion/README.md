Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour format. 

 - 24-hour format divides the day into 24 hours from `00` to `23`, each of which has 60 minutes from `00` to `59`.
- 12-hour format divides the day into two halves: the first half is `AM`, and the second half is `PM`. In each half, the hours are numbered in the order `12, 01, 02, 03, …, 11`. Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from `00` to `59`.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1440`) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string `s` of length `5` with format `hh:mm` representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. `hh` represents the hour from `00` to `23`, and `mm` represents the minute from `00` to `59`.

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

## Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("`hh:mm AM`" or "`hh:mm PM`"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not remove leading zeroes.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
11
09:41
18:06
12:14
00:59
00:00
14:34
01:01
19:07
11:59
12:00
21:37
```

**Output:**

```
09:41 AM
06:06 PM
12:14 PM
12:59 AM
12:00 AM
02:34 PM
01:01 AM
07:07 PM
11:59 AM
12:00 PM
09:37 PM

```
