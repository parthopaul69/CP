You are playing your favorite rhythm game, osu!mania. The layout of your beatmap consists of `n` rows and `4` columns. Because notes at the bottom are closer, you will process the bottommost row first and the topmost row last. Each row will contain exactly one note, represented as a '#'.

For each note `1, 2, …, n`, in the order of processing, output the column in which the note appears.

## Input

The first line contains `t` (`1 ≤ t ≤ 100`) — the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains `n` (`1 ≤ n ≤ 500`) — the number of rows of the beatmap.

The following `n` lines contain `4` characters. The `i`-th line represents the `i`-th row of the beatmap from the top. It is guaranteed that the characters are either '.' or '#', and exactly one of the characters is '#'. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `500`.

## Output

For each test case, output `n` integers on a new line, the column that the `i`-th note appears in for all `i` from `1` to `n`.

## Examples

**Example:**

```
3
4
#...
.#..
..#.
...#
2
.#..
.#..
1
...#
```

**Output:**

```
4 3 2 1 
2 2 
4 

```
